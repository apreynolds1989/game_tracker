                <p>Below is a table that will list NHL players and their stats drawn from an API and will be sortable based on the number of games each player has on the standard weekly fantasy hockey schedule. Will also list the off-day games (Monday/Wednesday/Friday/Sunday). Will likely need a second table to account for Goalies, their stats and their expected starts. Possibly be able to filter from one table to the other rather than have two tales.</p>
